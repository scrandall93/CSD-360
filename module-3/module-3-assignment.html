       <p> Missing A Flight to Paris </p>

       <p> A little over a year and a half ago, my wife and I were heading off for a trip around Europe
        for our <span id = "honeymoon"> _________
        </span>. We woke up at 4am the day after our wedding and drove an hour and fifteen minutes from Tuscaloosa, AL 
        to the airport in Birmingham, AL to catch our first flight to Chicago. From there, we would be flying to Paris, France for our
        first leg of the trip.</p>

       <p> As we were landing in Chicago, we both got notifications that Paris had changed its entry requirements and now required a negative COVID
        test taken within 24 hours of boarding the plane. Before the change, the entry requirement was only proof of vaccination, and proof of booster
        shot within the last month. As we landed, we realized we were going to have to figure out a place to get a rapid test, find how to get there, and be back
        to board, all within 45 minutes of landing. <span id = "theSprint">
        ______________________________ </span>, in an effort to knock out the requirements needed. We found a rapid test clinic right outside of the airport, paid $300 a 
        piece for the expedited turnaround, and booked it back to our gate.</p>

       <p> Upon making it back to our gate, we then began desperately refreshing our phones, hoping the test would show up. The flight began to board as we paced
        back and forth, hoping the test would come through. As everyone boarded and the shutdown process began, my wifes test came through! The amazing gate agent 
        held the plane for another two minutes in hopes that mine would come through next. As the two minutes came to an end, we realized mine was likely not coming
        in time. The gate agent closed off the doors to the plane and we began figuring out what was next. Almost poetically, as the gate agent locked the door and 
        disconnected the walk-on from the plane, my test made it through. <span id= "tooLate"> __________________ </span>. We stayed overnight in Chicago and ended up 
        having so much fun. We got to walk around the city and saw The Bean, ate a Chicago style pizza (that the owner of the pizzeria gave to use for free after we
        told her our story), visited the Christkindlmarket Market, and even did a little shopping! While we were not thrilled to miss our flight, we did learn that you have to look at the brightside in a 
        bad situation, which is exactly what we did! </p>
